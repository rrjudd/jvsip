On Dec 21, 2011 I have officially started a new distribution Called JVSIP. I plan
to maintain and distribute this through github.com. The MIT License I moved to after
I retired is retained for this new release.

Randall Judd was a US Government Employee until February 2, 2006 when he retired
and became a consultant specializing in VSIPL and programing methods for portable
software development.  The conversion from employee to retiree and part time consultant 
requires additions to the copyright notice.

Note that actual development of the TVCPP VSIPL reference implementation is not something
I do as part of a consulting agreement, so I am free to use any license I choose.

The MIT License seems to fit my requirements ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT )
