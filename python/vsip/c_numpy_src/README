This directory contains code to enable use of copy to and from numpy arrays and
pyJvsip views of type _f and _d, complex or real.
To make you must do
swig -python jvsipNumpyUtils.i
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

In the current version I  have the setup.py file load numpy which has a
get_include function and looks for the proper include file location.
That seems to work for me. Information below might be needed if it fails to
 work.

IMPORTANT
Just because you have the numpy module does not mean you can compile code to the numpy C api.
You need to make sure the header files are available where the compiler can find them.
Search around in your numpy distribution until you find them and then set a link.

For Instance On a Mac with OS X and Xcode:
EXAMPLE 1
After installing python, numpy, scipy, etc. on my mac using brew and pip and instructions at

http://www.lowindata.com/2013/installing-scientific-python-on-mac-os-x/

I found numpy headers at

/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy

and did in a terminal (directory at /usr/local/include)

ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy numpy

Then the above instructions worked fine.

EXAMPLE 2
Before doing the install of an environment in /usr/local (and changing my paths so /usr/local/bin is searched first) my python environment was in /Library/Frameworks.

For this case I did in a terminal (directory at /usr/local/include)

ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Headers/numpy numpy 

The jvsipNumpyUtils module is only needed to interface to numpy module and only supports data copies with some performance.
If you can't get it to install properly its not a show stopper. Just a minor inconvenience.

In the future I may add more to this module; but I will keep it separate from the vsip and pyJvsip modules so that numpy is not a requirement for pyJvsip.
